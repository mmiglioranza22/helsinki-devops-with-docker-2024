To deploy the docker image in render, Dockerfile needs to be modified including `--platform=linux/amd64` flag
in FROM. (Render only supports images with linux platform apparently).

So build the new image with a specific tag for Render (deploy):
 
 docker build -t mmiglioranza22/country-hook-example:deploy .    

Push tag 
 
 docker image push --all-tags mmiglioranza22/country-hook-example

Create a new webservice from "Existing image" option in Render Dashboard.

Type the platform-specific image and connect.
